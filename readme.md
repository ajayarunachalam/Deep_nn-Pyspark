## What is Drug Discovery and Why has it been common these days ?
> In the fields of medicine, biotechnology and pharmacology, drug discovery is the process by which new candidate medications are discovered. We harness the power of Machine learning to build efficient machines to power up the drug discovery process. We've used several approaches and ended up with a single one , which proved to be really efficient.
> The data is taken from Pubchem server and we provide almost a "on the spot" or "realtime" data check on Drug Discovery.


## Different Approaches we tried ?
> We've tried to Use simple machine learning to solve the problem , which seemed to be too unefficient. Hence we went to Deep learning , where we used spark to work on the huge data package. We build clusters of individual groups , hence reaching a whooping number of 65 Graphs.
> Further more individually the smaller graphs were trained on Logistic Regression or SVM and the larger models were trained on Deep nerual network.
> The deployment is under process currently.

## Most Efficient one ?
> The one approach where the clusters were trained on different kinds of models , we came across a result of 80% accuracy was the best one. Due to lack of computational power , hyperparameter tuning was not done.

## How to use it ?
> Once the deployment is done , The links would be available here.
