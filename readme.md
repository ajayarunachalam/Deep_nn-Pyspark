## What is Drug Discovery and Why has it been common these days ?
> In the fields of medicine, biotechnology and pharmacology, drug discovery is the process by which new candidate medications are discovered. We harness the power of Machine learning to build efficient machines to power up the drug discovery process. We've used several approaches and ended up with a single one , which proved to be really efficient.
> The data is taken from Pubchem server and we provide almost a "on the spot" / "realtime" data check on Drug Discovery.
